There are three main electrical systems in the rocket. The avionics bay is where most of the electronics are stored and where the flight computer is located to cause the seperation events. The airbreaks which can add drag to the rocket if the projected apogee is higher than our target, and the payload system which will extend an antenna in the vertical-most position once the rocket has landed.
